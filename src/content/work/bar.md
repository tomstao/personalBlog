After leaving the sushi world, I found myself on the other side of the counter—behind the bar. It wasn’t just about mixing drinks; it was about reading the room, holding a vibe, and knowing when to listen or when to pour fast. The pace was wild, the nights were long, and I loved the rhythm of it—until I didn’t. I moved on, but the sharp instincts and people skills stayed with me.

- I can still pour a perfect pint with my eyes closed.
- No, I won’t judge your drink order (unless it’s a Long Island at 11 a.m.).
