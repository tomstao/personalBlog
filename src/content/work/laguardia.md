Now, I’m studying computer science—yeah, a big leap from sushi knives and cocktail shakers. But I found something I genuinely enjoy in programming: building things, solving problems, and always learning something new. It clicked for me, so I decided to go all in and pursue the degree. Different tools, same drive.

- I used to serve omakase and old fashioneds. Now I serve functions and for-loops.
- Late nights at the bar taught me endurance. Debugging at 2 a.m. just builds on that.
