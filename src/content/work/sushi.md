I spent years behind the sushi bar—slicing fish, rolling rice, and obsessing over the tiny details that turn food into an experience. The high-pressure kitchen taught me precision, patience, and how to stay cool when it counts. But over time, I realized that path wasn’t mine. I’ve since hung up the apron, but I bring that same focus and creativity into everything I do now.

- Want me to make sushi for you? Bring me your fish!
- Fun fact: crab stick isn’t crab. It’s fish pretending to be crab.
