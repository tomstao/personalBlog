A simple chatbot project I built to learn how the Mastra framework and Vercel AI SDK work together. The chatbot has a fitness coach persona and includes a basic BMI calculator tool.

## What I Learned

- How to define agents and tools with Mastra
- How the Vercel AI SDK's `useChat` hook manages chat state
- How to format responses for the AI SDK data stream protocol

## Tech Stack

- Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- Mastra framework with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Zod for tool input/output validation
