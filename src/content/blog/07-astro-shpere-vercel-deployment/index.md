# A simple tutorial about deploying your personal site

This is going to be my first blog. I decided to talk about how you can deploy a personal site. Own a personal site is kind of exciting, I've planned it for a while, after I actually began to build one, I found that it is much easier than I thought, without further ado, let's start it.

## 1.You need a template or you can build one yourself

If you want to build one for yourself, you can try to use Astro. Because its 0-JS by default philosophy makes it can build an extremely fast static sites like a personal blog. But, if you decide to use a template just like I did, I have a few recommendation:
 
* [Astro sphere(the one I'm using)](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere.git)

    [Showcase](https://astro-sphere-demo.vercel.app/)
    
    This template is less popular than other two templates I'm going to show you, but it has an elegant simple design and night mode. If you want to use this template, I recommend you to deploy it on Vercel for easy set up.
* [Astro wind( current one of the most popular templates on GitHub)](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind.git)

    [Showcase](https://astrowind.vercel.app/)

    This template is current one of the most popular templates on GitHub, it offers mobile app, start up and personal usages for free.
